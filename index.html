	    </header>
	    <main>
	      <p>Twenty-word stories, to the theme of <i>Revolution</i>. From the
		session on 15 October.</p>

	      <ul>
		<li><i>They set her on fire. Burned her at the stake,
		    shouting, “revolution!” She laughed as they laid her
		    corpse down.</i></li>

		<li><i>Men and women took up arms. We fought fierce battles with the
		    loyalists. Alas, our blood was shed in vain.</i></li>

		<li><i>They really wanted to start a revolution, poured their hearts and
		    souls into it. It’s a shame they were ants.</i></li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <p>Thanks to our lovely members for contributing these

	      <p>That's Orson Welles, or something like that.</p>

	      <p>Yesterday's session was about writing under restrictions. A huge
		thanks to everyone who participated in the twenty-word-story
		challenge, to the theme of 'revolution'. We hope you enjoyed it! We
		loved how varied the responses were.</p>

	      <p>The take-home challenge this week is to put together a lipogram,
		where the use of the letters O and S is forbidden. We can't wait to
		hear what people come up with.</p>

	      <p>Our next meeting will be at <b>6:30PM on Tuesday, 22 October,</b>
		in <b>SAF 121.</b> See you there!</p>

		done some editing, or if you have something else
		entirely you would like to share ⁠— remember that you
		are welcome to read your piece at the beginning of the
		next session!</p>
	      <p>Our next meeting will be at <b>6:30PM on Tuesday, 15
		  October,</b> in <b>SAF 121.</b> We look forward to
		seeing you there!</p>
